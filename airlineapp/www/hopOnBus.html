    The SIA Hop-On touring system offers visitors an easy way to
    enjoy Singapore sights. Covering 4 bus routes (red, yellow, blue
    and brown line) with strategically located stops across the city, it
    is an efficient way of touring Singapore at your
    own pace. More than a tour, it also doubles up as a
    transportation system. With a 24-hour validity, you
    get to start your tours at your own time. It is now
    easier to see more of Singapore for less. Do look
    out for the City Sightseeing red front livery before
    you board the bus.
