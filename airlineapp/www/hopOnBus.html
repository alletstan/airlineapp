        The SIA Hop-On touring system offers visitors an easy way to
        enjoy Singapore sights. Covering 4 bus routes (red, yellow, blue
        and brown line) with strategically located stops across the city, it
        is an efficient way of touring Singapore at your
        own pace. More than a tour, it also doubles up as a
        transportation system. With a 24-hour validity, you
        get to start your tours at your own time. It is now
        easier to see more of Singapore for less. Do look
        out for the City Sightseeing red front livery before
        you board the bus.
