        The warm water here is blue. You heard me, blue. Not murky like what we’re used to seeing at East Coast Park.
        That makes this place perfect for snorkeling especially since it is teeming with biodiversity. Some of Singapore’s
        richest coral reefs reside here.
        <br><br>
        Besides snorkelling and swimming in clean waters, visitors can picnic under shady palm trees or even apply for a camp
        permit here! Additionally, NParks has designed Sisters Islands to be a marine park as of July 2014, which means there
        will be free guided tours here. Do not miss this out as dolphins(!!!) have been sighted here!

      <p style="text-align: justify; opacity: 1; padding-top: 0px; font-size:15px; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em;">
        The exterior of this temple projects sheer majestic elegance inspired by the Tang dynasty. It's still a place
        of worship, so you'll be in for a cultural experience as you get to see devotees chanting in the large hall on
        the ground level. The head monks pay no attention to you as they lead their procession. It's almost as if you've
        put on an invisibility cloak and sneaked inside their secret world.
        <br><br>
        Buddha’s Tooth Temple draws Buddhist devotees from all over the world because it houses an alleged tooth from Siddharta
        Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, located at the top level. Simple vegetarian fare is served for free here too, although
        donations are welcomed.
        <br><br>
        You can walk here from either Chinatown MRT or Tanjong Pagar MRT and it is just opposite Maxwell Market.

        Be rewarded with gorgeous views of the flora, fauna, and cityscape as you start trekking upwards from the foot
        of Mount Faber. Bits and pieces of Singapore and her history come to life at the stretch of copper-tooled murals
        beneath the summit’s platform. Trudge on a little more and brace yourself for a breathtaking bird’s eye view of Singapore’s
         skyline at the peak! Mental note to self: Stop procrastinating and start some intense leg work already.

        Movie Mob gives you the best old-school outdoor movie experience you can dream of. The drive-in concept and
         picnic events are popular among those in the community.
         <br><br>
         Screenings take place at different locations all across Singapore. Plus, you get to vote for the movie you want
          to watch! I say this beats having to shell out about $12 for a weekend movie ticket at the cinema.

        Get your adrenaline pumping as you mountain-bike your way through 6km of fun and thrills. The Bukit Timah Mountain Bike
         Trail has recently undergone restoration works so it is now much safer for bikers to embark on their adventure. With vigorous
          climbs and downhill slopes, this trail is perfect for the more experienced bikers.
        <br><br>
        Getting Here: The 2 preferred starting points are at the Visitor Centre Carpark at Hindhede Road, and at the Dairy Farm Car Park.

        Be awestruck as thoughts like ‘how do they survive here?’, ‘OMG, does rainwater get into their homes?’ and
        ‘here got wifi anot?’ dance around your head once you set foot in Kampong Lorong Buangkok. This is the kind of
        space that young Singaporeans have never seen.
        <br><br>
        Getting Here: The Kampong is located near Gerald Drive off Yio Chu Kang Road.
