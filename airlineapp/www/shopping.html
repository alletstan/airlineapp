        The weekend flea market used to be held here before moving to Lucky Plaza. But that's okay, because *Scape is still
         a great place where you can find many blogshops selling their clothing items at a cheaper price than you'd find online.
          Its also excellent for accessories like rings and necklaces that can be rather unique.
<br>
Visit *Scape underground for more cheap thrills. My personal favourite thing to buy here is make up from the brand elf for $3 a piece!
        <br><br>
        Price Range: $1- $20

        Honestly speaking, thrifting may not be everybody's cup of tea. However, if you visit the thrift store loaded with patience,
        there are plenty of gems waiting to be discovered. It will take a little bit of rummaging through racks of slightly grotty
        clothes but you are almost certain to find at least one thing that will tickle your fancy. A friend of mine found a black
        velvet skirt which she wore to prom for $2. Nope you didn't read that wrong, half a prom outfit for $2!
        <br>
        Don't be afraid to cut, stud or fray the clothes you buy to add your own personal flavour. So channel your inner Macklemore,
         head down to the thrift shop and bask in all it's second hand glory.
        <br><br>
        Price Range: $1- $10

        Here is where you'll find teenagers selling their old clothes for some extra pocket money. This means that clothes
        here are usually more trendy and fashionable than the ones from the thrift shop and therefore also priced slightly
         higher than at thrift shops.
         <br>
         Items here may either be pre-loved or brand new, depending on the seller. On good days, you might even managed to score some of
         last season's threads from Topshop and Zara at a fraction of the cost!

        Bugis Street is touted as the biggest street shopping location in Singapore and its completely true. One can very easily get
         lost in the labyrinth-like alleys within this bazaar. Despite that, it is still worth a visit as you will find a myriad of
         different clothes, from female to male, trendy to completely unfashionable, tasteful to vulgar, whatever is it you seek, you will find.

    <p style="text-align: justify; opacity: 1; padding-top: 0px; font-size:15px; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em;">
      Lucky Plaza is known for being a hub for the Filipino Community in Singapore. But look a bit deeper and you'll realise
       that it's also a shopper's paradise! It's full of shops selling really cheap jewellery- I'm talking 3 for $10 headbands,
       watches and accessories- and really cheap clothes too. Being situated right smack in the centre of Orchard Road, it really is incredible.
  <br><br>
  Check out Speed Fashion on the 4th floor for tops starting from $2 a piece. The ladies working here are really friendly too and
  despite being a store, I've managed to get away with bargaining as well. That's right, kiasu Singaporean in the house!

      Any student on a limited budget would know that Far East Plaza is the place to be to shop cheap in Orchard. Its 6 floors of
      unbeatable deals on just about anything you can wear on your body. There are so many stores here that it can be rather overwhelming
       so its best to go prepared and know that you will never, and I mean never, be able to visit all of them.
  <br><br>
  Far East is also great if you're looking for a spa day on the cheap side. I've heard rumours that there is a shop offering a $3 express
   manicure and I don't know about you but that sure makes me want to jump out of my seat right now and speed down there. Its also a great
    place to get your hair done. Check out HairyCulture on the 4th floor which specialises in cornrows!

      Price Range: $3- $20

    <p style="text-align: justify; opacity: 1; padding-top: 0px; font-size:15px; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em;">
      City Plaza is a unique shopping destination because it is a wholesale mall which provides blogshops with their stock.
      That being said, you don't have to own a blogshop to enjoy these deals as fierce competition means that shop owners
      have had to retail their products to regular customers too at a slightly higher price. But hey, you still won't hear me complaining!
  <br><br>
  Get a great big group of girlfriends and make a field-trip of sorts down to City Plaza so you can get
  a wholesale price. The more the merrier! Trust me, its worth it. With City Plaza, you'll never have to fall prey to
  ridiculously overpriced clothes again. Never. Ever. No.
      <br><br>
      Price Range: $5- $20

    <p style="text-align: justify; opacity: 1; padding-top: 0px; font-size:15px; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em;">
      Anchorpoint is the first mall in Singapore to feature a cluster of outlet stores. Here you'll find brand names like
      Cotton On, Billabong, G2000 and Charles and Keith to name a few. Past season products are sold at 20% to 70% discounts.
  <br><br>
  The idea here is not to buy products that are super cheap but to save the most by finding the best deals. The most valuable would
   be Cotton On, simply because the deals are insane. Perfect to buy sunglasses because they
  go for as low as $1! And sunglasses never go out of style, especially not in Singapore!
      <br><br>
      Price Range: $5- $30

      Editor's Market is easily the most fashion forward option out of all these mentioned. The idea is similar to that
      of City Plaza in the sense that the more pieces you buy, the cheaper it is. I love the look of the store as well,
      its very industrial chic, with nothing to distract you from your main goal- clothes!
